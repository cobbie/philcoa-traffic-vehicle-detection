This submission for CS 129.18 contains code for 3 objected detection processes: first, one for our original ground truth data which underwent reduction in resolution and shaking correction, second, the same video but went through background subtraction, and third, a homographized video that is quite warped (output was not desirable). It also contains code for background subtraction on the video, which was done as a preprocessing step. The video is of a road along Sta. Lucia, specifically, PhilCOA street. The project used ImageAI: 
"A python library built to empower developers to build applications and systems with self-contained Deep Learning and Computer Vision capabilities using simple and few lines of code. "

The model and the videos, given their length and quality, were too large to upload to Moodle, thus, a google drive was used. They can be found here:
